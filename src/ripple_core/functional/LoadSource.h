/** Tracks the consumption of resources at an endpoint.

    To prevent monopolization of server resources or attacks on servers,
    resource consumption is monitored at each endpoint. When consumption
    exceeds certain thresholds, costs are imposed. Costs include charging
    additional XRP for transactions, requiring a proof of work to be
    performed, or simply disconnecting the endpoint.

    Currently, consumption endpoints include websocket connections used to
    service clients, and peer connections used to create the peer to peer
    overlay network implementing the Ripple protcool.

    The current "balance" of a LoadSource represents resource consumption
    debt or credit. Debt is accrued when bad loads are imposed. Credit is
    granted when good loads are imposed. When the balance crosses heuristic
    thresholds, costs are increased on the endpoint.

    The balance is represented as a unitless relative quantity.

    @note Although RPC connections consume resources, they are transient and
          cannot be rate limited. It is advised not to expose RPC interfaces
          to the general public.
